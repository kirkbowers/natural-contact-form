/**
 * Plugin Name: mvcoffee-wp
 * Plugin URI: http://mvcoffee.org
 * Description: This is a developer plugin that provides a Rails-like server side Model layer that is compatible with the client-side MVC framework MVCoffee.  At the moment it is incomplete, completely ad hoc for use within the Natural Contact Form plugin, only containing functionality needed specifically for that plugin.  I anticipate it eventually also providing the mvcoffee.js client for client-side model validation.
